# Project 3: Experimental Analysis

## Introduction
In this project, an experimental analysis on the doubly linked list,
singly linked list, vector, and self-balancing binary search tree data
structure implementations in the C++ standard library are performed.
The analysis enables a comparison between theoretical big-O efficiency
to real-world performance.

### Compilation & Execution
Compile code using: `g++ -std=c++11 project3.cc -o <executable-name>`

Code can be executed using: `~$ ./<executable-name>`
